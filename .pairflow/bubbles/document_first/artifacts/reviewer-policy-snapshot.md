# Reviewer Policy Snapshot

## Runtime Review Threshold
- Current post-gate routing threshold: `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity=P3`.
- Current post-gate routing threshold is `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity=P3` (default baseline). A `P3`-only finding set can still remain reviewer-blocking after `severity_gate_round`; this is a configuration baseline, not a redefinition of `P3` severity.
- This threshold controls reviewer PASS vs convergence after `severity_gate_round`; it does not redefine the canonical `P0/P1/P2/P3` severity meanings.
- Document scope qualifier: CLI `--finding` carries severity/title/refs only. For post-gate routing, document-scope `P0/P1` is blocker-grade only with strict qualifiers (`timing=required-now` + `layer=L1`). Without those qualifiers the finding is treated as `P2` for routing-threshold evaluation.
- Canonical ontology source: `docs/reviewer-severity-ontology.md`.

## Canonical Severity Ontology

# Reviewer Severity Ontology (v1)

**Date:** 2026-02-28  
**Status:** Canonical policy (active)

## Purpose

This document is the canonical severity policy for reviewer findings.

Goals:
1. Keep `P0/P1/P2/P3` stable across rounds.
2. Prevent severity inflation and deflation.
3. Make reviewer decisions predictable and auditable.

## Scope

This ontology applies to reviewer findings in Pairflow loops.
It does not replace task acceptance criteria; it complements them.

## Runtime Reminder Block (Build Source)

The block below is the canonical source for runtime reviewer reminder text.
It is consumed by a build/codegen step and embedded into TypeScript so runtime
prompts do not depend on reading this markdown file from disk.

<!-- pairflow:runtime-reminder:start -->
- Blocker severities (`P0/P1`) require concrete evidence (repro, failing check output, or precise code-path proof).
- Without blocker-grade evidence (`P0/P1`), downgrade to `P2` by default.
- Post-gate reviewer routing is controlled by `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity`, not by a fixed `P0/P1` blocker vs `P2/P3` advisory split.
- Default baseline `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity=P3` means a `P3`-only post-gate finding set can still remain reviewer-blocking; that is a configuration baseline, not a redefinition of `P3`.
- In document scope, `P0/P1` is blocker-grade post-gate only with strict qualifiers (`timing=required-now` + `layer=L1`); otherwise it is treated as `P2` for routing-threshold evaluation.
- Cosmetic/comment-only findings are `P3`.
- Out-of-scope observations should be notes (`P3`), not mandatory fix findings.

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Typical examples |
|---|---|---|
| `P0` | Critical blocker-level correctness/safety/runtime risk (highest urgency) | confirmed data loss path, critical security exposure, deterministic corruption/destructive behavior |
| `P1` | Blocker-level correctness/safety/runtime risk | data loss, crash, security issue, race condition, incorrect state transition, deterministic wrong behavior |
| `P2` | Real functional/quality gap, but not a blocker | missing edge-case handling, meaningful test gap, misleading logic with plausible future defect risk |
| `P3` | Non-blocking improvement | naming, comments, minor consistency/refactor/documentation cleanup |

## Evidence Requirement by Severity

### `P0` evidence (required)
At least one of:
1. Deterministic reproduction steps.
2. Concrete failing test or failing check output.
3. Precise code-path proof showing incorrect runtime behavior.

Without blocker-grade evidence (`P0/P1`), downgrade to `P2` by default.

### `P1` evidence (required)
At least one of:
1. Deterministic reproduction steps.
2. Concrete failing test or failing check output.
3. Precise code-path proof showing incorrect runtime behavior.

Without blocker-grade evidence (`P0/P1`), downgrade to `P2` by default.

### `P2` evidence (required)
1. Concrete functional or quality risk statement.
2. Traceable location/path.
3. Clear expected-vs-actual explanation.

### `P3` evidence (lightweight)
1. Localized suggestion and rationale.

## Stability Rules (Anti-Drift)

1. Cosmetic/comment-only findings cannot be `P2+`.
2. Severity cannot escalate across rounds without new evidence.
3. "Might be risky" claims are not `P0/P1` by default.
4. Out-of-scope observations default to note-level (`P3`/informational), not mandatory fix findings.
5. Reviewer should avoid contradictory follow-up direction unless new evidence justifies the change.

## Reviewer Output Contract

Each finding should include:
1. `severity`
2. `title`
3. `why_this_severity` (short)
4. `evidence` (repro/test/code-path)
5. `scope_link` (acceptance criterion or explicit risk category)

### Runtime PASS Evidence Binding

Reviewer PASS with any `P0/P1` finding must have evidence bound at finding level:
1. Preferred CLI form: `--finding "P1:Title|ref1,ref2"` (maps to `finding.refs`).
2. If a single ref contains a comma, escape it as `\,` inside the `--finding` value.
3. CLI shorthand is backward-compatible and additive: every parsed `--finding` result gets `timing=later-hardening` and `layer=L1` defaults.
4. Envelope-level `--ref` values are optional generic artifacts only; they do not satisfy blocker finding evidence binding.
5. If a `P0/P1` finding has no finding-level refs, PASS is rejected.
6. Document-scope qualifier: post-gate blocker semantics still require strict finding qualifiers (`timing=required-now` + `layer=L1`). The shorthand defaults above do not strengthen blocker policy, so CLI shorthand `P0/P1` remains advisory for post-gate routing unless explicit blocker qualifiers are present.

## Decision Mapping

1. Round `< severity_gate_round` (default `4`): reviewer canonical pass emit (`pairflow agent emit --kind pass ...`) remains allowed (including non-blocking findings), while canonical convergence emit (`pairflow agent emit --kind convergence ...`) is still allowed when policy preconditions are met.
2. Round `>= severity_gate_round` with one or more findings that meet `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity` under scope policy: reviewer should request a fix cycle with canonical pass emit (`pairflow agent emit --kind pass ...`).
   Default baseline note: `review_policy.reviewer_blocking_min_severity=P3`, so a `P3`-only post-gate finding set can still remain reviewer-blocking because of configuration.
   If the threshold is tightened to `P2` or `P1`, findings below that threshold become advisory for routing while the severity ontology itself stays unchanged.
   Document scope blocker-grade `P0/P1` still requires strict qualifiers (`timing=required-now` + `layer=L1`); without those qualifiers the finding is treated as `P2` for routing-threshold evaluation.
   Operational command form: `pairflow agent emit --kind pass --repo <repo> --bubble-id <id> --handoff-id <handoff-id> --execution-id <execution-id> --summary "..." --finding "<severity>:Title|artifact://ref"` (repeat `--finding` as needed).
3. Round `>= severity_gate_round` with only findings below the current threshold or clean result: reviewer should use canonical convergence emit (`pairflow agent emit --kind convergence ...`).
   Operational command forms:
   - Below-threshold findings: `pairflow agent emit --kind convergence --repo <repo> --bubble-id <id> --handoff-id <handoff-id> --execution-id <execution-id> --summary "..." --finding "<severity>:Title|artifact://ref"`.
   - Clean (no findings): `pairflow agent emit --kind convergence --repo <repo> --bubble-id <id> --handoff-id <handoff-id> --execution-id <execution-id> --summary "..."` (without `--finding`).

## Command Consistency Guardrails

1. Never make summary-only finding claims without structured `--finding` payload.
2. Never claim `clean/no findings` while structured findings are present in the same handoff.
3. Terminology lock: use `--finding`; do not reintroduce `--advisory-finding`.

## Operational Use

This file is intended to be:
1. Referenced by optimization/tracker docs.
2. Reflected in reviewer prompt templates and handoff guidance.
3. Used as review calibration baseline in loop metrics analysis.
